    "    \"Why we pay an Admission Fee\": \"\"\"\n",
    "While RITA Africaâ€™s training and certification programs are fully funded through sponsorship, the sponsorship covers only the educational and certification aspects of the program.

    "\n",
    "=> Administrative Costs: Managing applications, coordinating bootcamps, and processing enrollments involve significant administrative efforts. The admission fee helps offset these operational costs, ensuring a smooth and professional experience for all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Program Logistics: From maintaining our learning management systems to providing technical support during your training journey, the fee helps us sustain these critical components that enable effective learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This small investment from students not only secures a place in our comprehensive training program but also fosters a sense of commitment and responsibility toward their educational journey. With this approach, we aim to empower aspiring tech professionals across Africa, enabling them to kickstart their careers without financial burden. This model ensures that students who enter the main program are well-prepared and committed to completing it successfully.\n",
